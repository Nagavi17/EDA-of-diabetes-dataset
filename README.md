# EDA-of-diabetes-dataset
This exploratory data analysis (EDA) examines a diabetes dataset.  The analysis begins with an initial inspection of the data using `head()` and `tail()` to view the first and last few rows, and `describe()` to get summary statistics (count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, quartiles) for numerical columns.  `max()` shows the maximum value for each column.

Next, the analysis focuses on the 'Outcome' column, which likely indicates whether a patient has diabetes (1) or not (0). The code calculates and displays the frequency of each outcome (number of patients with and without diabetes), the proportion of each outcome relative to the total number of patients, and various descriptive statistics (mean, median, max, min, sum, product) for the 'Outcome' column.  These statistics provide a basic understanding of the class distribution.

The data is then sorted by 'BloodPressure' in ascending and descending order, displaying the top few rows of each sorted dataset.  This allows for observation of extreme values and patterns within the blood pressure data.  The code then filters the data based on 'Outcome' to separate diabetic and non-diabetic patients, and further filters based on 'Age' to examine patients aged 50 or older.

Additional filtering is performed based on combinations of criteria (e.g., age and blood pressure, outcome and pregnancies), demonstrating how to select subsets of data based on specific conditions.  Summary statistics (sum, product, mean, median) are calculated for 'Pregnancies' within these filtered datasets, illustrating how summary statistics change based on different subsets.

Finally, the EDA visualizes the data using several plots generated by the Seaborn library:

* **Histogram of Age:** Shows the distribution of patient ages.
* **Boxplot of Blood Pressure by Outcome:**  Compares the distribution of blood pressure between diabetic and non-diabetic patients, highlighting potential differences in blood pressure levels between the two groups.
* **Scatter plot of Glucose vs. Insulin:** Visualizes the relationship between glucose and insulin levels, colored by outcome, allowing for the identification of any potential correlation or patterns between the variables.
* **Correlation Heatmap:** Shows the correlation coefficients between all numerical features in the dataset, providing insight into the relationships among the variables.
* **Pairplot:**  Displays scatter plots of all variable pairs, colored by outcome, facilitating the examination of pairwise relationships and patterns within the data.
* **Countplot of Outcome:** A simple count plot illustrating the number of patients with and without diabetes, reiterating the class imbalance observed earlier in the analysis.
